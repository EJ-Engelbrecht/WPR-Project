        <div class="ClientServer-define">Programs that run on a client's or user's device are called client-side applications, which are also known as front-end applications. The area of a website that users interact with is the focus of client-side engineers.The front end of an application that users can see is the main emphasis of this kind of engineering.

        <div class="ClientServer-define">Programming that takes place on a server is known as server-side development, often referred to as back-end development. Web browsers, or clients, communicate with web servers in order to retrieve information, making this kind of programming crucial. This development occurs on servers; thus users are not aware of it.
