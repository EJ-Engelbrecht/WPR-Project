            The World Wide Web (WWW), also referred to as the web, is an innovative technology that has radically changed how we access and share information. It is a sizable online network of interconnected digital resources and papers. The creation and growth of the web have altered contemporary communication, business, education, and entertainment.  The web was established by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he was employed at CERN to make it easier for scientists to share information among various computers and networks. Web pages, hyperlinks, web browsers, and web servers are its main building blocks.  Web pages are electronic documents that use HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to contain text, photos, videos, and interactive components. Users can move between various web pages or resources by clicking on hyperlinks, also known as links, that are embedded into web pages. HTML code is interpreted, and the material is presented in a user-friendly manner by web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. After receiving a request, web servers store and deliver web pages to users' browsers.  The web's addressing scheme is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The protocol (such as "http" or "https"), the domain name (such as www.example.com), and the route to the particular content are all specified. Users can access a wide variety of information thanks to this addressing system, including blogs, movies, e-commerce sites, and learning materials.
