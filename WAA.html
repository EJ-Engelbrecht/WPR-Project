            Web applications' server-side servers are in charge of handling user requests, business logic,
            and data storage. An application server is used, which manages requests, creates dynamic content,
            and interacts with databases. For this, server-side programming languages like PHP, Python, and
            Java are employed.

            APIs specify how various software components communicate and share data.
            They enable smooth functional integration by facilitating communication between the client-side
            and server-side components. Additionally, today, APIs are treated more like products than code.
            They are designed for consumption for specific audiences (e.g. mobile developers), and they are
            documented and versioned in a way that enables users to have clear expectations of their
            maintenance and lifecycle.

            Databases are used to manage and store data for applications. Depending on the structure
            and data needs of the application, they may be relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL
            or NoSQL databases like MongoDB. Communication between the database and web server become vital
            in smooth operation.

        A single, unified codebase serves as the foundation of this web application architecture.
        This indicates that the entire application's code, including the user interface, business logic,
        and database access logic, is contained in the codebase. The same runtime environment is shared by all
        of the application's components. Although it makes development simpler, as applications expand,
        it can become cumbersome, creating scalability and maintenance issues.

        Developers are free to concentrate solely on writing code thanks to serverless architecture,
        which abstracts server management. Services like Azure Functions and AWS Lambda automatically scale
        as necessary. With this architecture, a web application can be deployed without the need to manage
        the underlying infrastructure. Web applications that require high levels of scalability,
        such as e-commerce, gaming, and streaming applications, are typical use cases for serverless web
        application architecture.

        Using APIs, microservices divide an application into smaller, independent services.
        This improves maintenance, scalability, and flexibility but complicates managing interactions between
        services. Each service in a microservices web application architecture is created to carry out
        a particular function. Each service can be managed and modified independently of the other services,
        which keeps the codebase maintainable. Additionally, services can be independently deployed, scaled,
        and managed. The performance of the application can be controlled more precisely thanks to this, and
        it also makes changes simple and quick for developers.
