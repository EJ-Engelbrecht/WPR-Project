                <p>A network of websites with addresses is known as the World Wide Web. It was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee at the CERN physics laboratory in Europe, which houses the Hadron Collider. The creation of the web took place over the course of several years, beginning with Berners-Lee's initial concept in 1989 and ending with the version co-authored with Robert Calliou in 1990.  In 1993, the resulting software was released into the public domain, enabling businesses and individuals all over the world to build their own websites and exchange information. About 2 billion web pages, holding a wide variety of content, are already available, according to CERN.  The official beginning of the World Wide Web, according to the Mozilla Foundation, occurred in 1991, two years before it was made available to the public. The HTTP data transfer protocol, the most widely used online publication format, HTML, and consistent resource locations (URLs) for each web page are the three fundamental indi     vidual parts of the internet.

                <p>The web's supporting infrastructure is made up of a network of networks called the internet. According to NBC News, the Department of Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency began working on an early version of the internet in 1969. This mainframe computer network, known as ARPANET, eventually developed into the foundation for all digital data transmission.  The World Wide Web is one of the primary methods of accessing the internet, and websites are still essentially a requirement for businesses operating in the modern era, but according to NBC News, some of the most widely used internet connectivity features today—such as sending emails, using file transfer protocols, using mobile apps, and instant messaging—are not necessarily web functions. Of all, using both the internet and the web is what you would be doing if you went to Gmail.com to send that email.
